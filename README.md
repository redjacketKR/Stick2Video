## Seamlessly Integrate Stick Figure Animations into Your Videos

Stick2Video is an innovative software solution that allows you to effortlessly combine stick figure animations with your main video content. Perfect for creators looking to add a unique, engaging element to their videos!

### Key Features:

1. **Intelligent Audio Sync**: Stick2Video uses high-frequency beep detection to precisely time the integration of your stick figure animation into the main video.

2. **Flexible Video Handling**: Works with various video durations and resolutions. Whether you have a 6-minute HD video or a shorter clip, Stick2Video can handle it.

3. **Custom Animation Placement**: Automatically positions your stick figure animation (e.g., 350x150 resolution) in the bottom center of your main video for a non-intrusive yet noticeable effect.

4. **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Simple controls make it easy to import your main video and stick figure animation, then let Stick2Video do the rest.

### How It Works:

1. Import your main video (e.g., a 6-minute HD flight video) and your stick figure animation (e.g., a 5.4-minute 350x150 animation).
2. Stick2Video listens for high-frequency beeps in the main video.
3. When a beep is detected, the software seamlessly integrates your stick animation into the bottom center of the main video.
4. The result is a perfectly synced composite video that combines your main content with engaging stick figure animations!
